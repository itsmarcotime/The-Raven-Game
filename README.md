## Description
My first game! Hope you enjoy! ðŸŒž Don't know what else to call this game except "The Raven Game" so lets just stick to that. The raven game challenges players to clear all the ravens before any of them make it full length across the screen. If the player fails to clear a raven the game is automatically over and the player's score is displayed! I will post a snap shot of my highest score! Can you beat it?

## Built-with
This application was built using HTML, CSS, & JavaScript.
